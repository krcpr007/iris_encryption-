# Project: Secure Image Encryption and Decryption using Deep Learning and Error-Correcting Codes

**Project Duration:** [JAN/2023 - MAY/2023]

**Project Description:**
Developed a cutting-edge image encryption and decryption system that ensured secure transmission and retrieval of sensitive images. This project involved a multi-step process integrating deep learning, error-correcting codes, and cryptographic techniques.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Image Normalization with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
   - Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks to preprocess and normalize the Iris image dataset.
   - Trained a custom CNN model to extract feature vectors from the images.

2. **Error-Correcting Code Integration:**
   - Integrated RS (Reed-Solomon) error-correcting codes for feature vector encoding and decoding.
   - Implemented BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) codes for secure data transmission.

3. **Image Encryption and Decryption:**
   - Employed the extracted feature vectors as encryption keys.
   - Performed XOR operations on pixel matrices to obtain encrypted images.
   - Successfully decrypted images using the same key on the recipient's end.

4. **NIST Randomness Tests:**
   - Conducted the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) randomness tests to validate the cryptographic strength of the generated keys.

5. **Colorful Decryption:** (Optional, if you implemented it)
   - Enhanced the system to enable colorful decryption of images.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Image processing libraries (PIL, OpenCV)
- Error-correcting codes (RS and/or BCH)
- NIST Randomness Test Suite

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
